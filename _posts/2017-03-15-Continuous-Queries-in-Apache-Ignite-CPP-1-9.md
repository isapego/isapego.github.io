title: Continuous Queries in Apache Ignite C++ 1.9
---

Hello. As some of you probably know Apache Ignite 1.9 has been [released](https://blogs.apache.org/ignite/entry/apache-ignite-1-9-released) last week and it brings some cool features. One of them is Continues Queries for Apache Ignite C++ and this is what I want to tell you about today.

First of all for those of you who does not know Apache Ignite has C++ API which is called Apache Ignite C++. It allows using Ignite features from native C++ applications.



That's all for today. Next I'm going to write more about C++ API of Apache Ignite. Now when I think about it maybe that's what I should have started from. Anyway I hope this was helpful for you.
